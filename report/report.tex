\section{Introduction}
%Keyu
Briefly discuss retail, deliveries \\
Introduce SRG, DIFOT and its impact (projected 100s of thousands saved) \\
Briefly outline solution (very brief and general)
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Project Scope and Plan}
%Hai
Briefly go over whole process \\
- data (comes first to provide good framework)\\
- analysis (second for functionality) \\
- usability (third for ease of use)

\subsection{Project Plan}
%Larysa
Release plan (each sprint is a release) \\
- Sprint 1: basic app that queries related data, end sem1 \\
- Sprint 2/3: app that provides DIFOT info (? 2 -> DIF, 3 -> DOT), end sem2 w8 \\
- Sprint 4: provides usability and report functionality, end sem2\\
\\
%Oliver
First sprint user stories \\
Expand on some, link to others \\
Discuss tasks and estimates (data cleaning)\\
\\
Cleaning the provided data was the biggest hurdle in the first sprint due to the large number and type of inconsistencies 
prevalent within. Resolving them required many queries to extract row duplicates and splits. 


\subsection{Feasability Analysis}
DIF - Current process \\
DOT - Not in widespread use
Difficulties in data cleaning/analysis due to largescale operation with many moving parts
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{The Artefact}
\subsection{Architecture}
SAP -> SQLServer -> C\# \\

\subsection{Technical Description}
ERD (expand heavily) \\
Cleaning scripts, SAP -> SQL \\
SQL -> C\# (brief)

\subsection{Functionality}
Related data (hopefully w/ import script) \\
C\# query application (screenshots) 

\subsection{Quality and Metrics}
\% of data related (hopefully 100\%) \\
unit tests for query responses, invalid queries, etc. \\
